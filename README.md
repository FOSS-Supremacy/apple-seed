# Apple Seed

The worlds-first fully open-source Attack On Titan fan game inspired on [Roark's Attack On Titan](https://roarkdev.itch.io/raot)

## Motivation

[Attack On Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan) is a wonderful manga with a deep and sad history, while the anime is good, the games aren't.

The Attack On Titan games has complex mechanics and bad performance for low/mid-end computers, killing the fun to play the game.

We consider the Roark's Attack On Titan fan game the best effort to create a good adaptation, but the mechanics are still complex, even with a gamepad.

The fan game ended its development (verify their Discord announcements), thus their players don't get updates anymore.

Another reason is because there's no 100% open-source Attack On Titan games, it's the first to use an open-source game engine.

We want to change the Attack On Titan gaming scenario once for all with a great game with easy mechanics and good performance.

## Goals

- A open-world with anime accuracy on the buildings
- Reallistic physics
