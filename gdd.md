# Game Design

Apple Seed is an 3D single-player/multiplayer open-world game focused on dynamic gameplay, simple mechanics and fun.

On this game you control a 3D player that can stay idle, walk, run, fly and attack with many weapons, the world is a mix of forests, hills, rivers and big flat lands of grass.

The game will follow the Attack On Titan universe, thus you expect cities inside 3 walls, these cities follow the classic [German architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Germany).

## Mechanics

Beyond the idle, walk, running and flying animations, the player will control the ODM functions.

The [ODM](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Omni-directional_mobility_gear_(Anime)) can fly forward, to up, to down, to left and to right, to change the fly route it use two hooks on each side of the player belt.

These hooks needs to grab something, be it a wall, a tree or building, if not the player can only do a small flight.

Thus you have two hook boxes on each belt and a motor with gas behind the player back, this gas needs to be reloaded with items on the map.

The ODM should be easy enough to make the gameplay comfortable and fun, with automatic hooking and dodge and optional things.

The automatic hooking will grab the most close thing if the player is flying, while the automatic dodge will avoid collisions.

The player also have a steel sword, this sword will be damaged by every attack and needs to be replaced after some attack.

The player can also cover behind walls, trees or boxes, like GTA 4.

The player can carry weapons, like a mosquete, the aim view should be the same as GTA 4.

The game will support bots and real players, the bots must use the Arma 3 AI (idle, see the target, follow his last path and attack)

## Graphics Design

The low-poly design fit well with anime-based games, also easier to model and make textures.

The game will support advanced graphics, like shadows, bloom, SSAO, AA, AF, Mipmapping, etc.

The game should have graphics auto-configuration based on the computer resources and power.

## Characters

It should contain the main characters of Attack On Titan, customizable and random faces would be good.

You can also play as a titan after a transformation

## Weapons

The [same weapons](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Firearms) of Attack On Titan.

The cannons and artillery will have an aim, like most war games.

## Enemies

You can fight with titans or humans, attacks on pacific humans will trigger the police to stop you.

### Police System

The Attack On Titan society has [3 military divisions](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Military), the game will only have [The Garrison](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Garrison) and [Survey Corps](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Survey_Corps).

- First threat level - The Garrison will follow you with pistols
- Second threat level - The Garrison will follow you with mosquetes
- Third threat level - The Garrison will follow you with horses and pistols
- Fourth threat level - The Garrison will follow you with horses and ODM with swords
- Fifth threat level - The Survey Corps will follow you with horses and ODM (they are more faster and smart than the military police)

### Titans

The titans attack outside the walls but can break the wall gate, there are titans of many sizes and speed.

Each titan will be killed with a sword or cannon/artillery shoot on the neck.

There are smart titans with humans inside, these will be bosses of the game.

Smart titans can destroy cannons/artillery and throw horses and rocks.
